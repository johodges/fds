# FDS Input Files for the PRISME Project

This directory contains FDS input files for simulations of various PRISME fire scenarios. PRISME is an OECD/NEA joint international research project on the topic of fire propagation. The PRISME project (PRISME is the French acronym for "Fire Propagation in Elementary Multi-Room Scenarios") is a fire model validation exercise proposed by IRSN in France. The three major research areas addressed by the PRISME project included: propagation of heat and smoke from the fire room to adjacent rooms, impact of heat and smoke on safety critical systems and the impact of the ventilation network on limiting heat and smoke propagation.
