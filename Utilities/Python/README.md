# Python Processing Scripts

This folder contains the Python scripts that process the output from the FDS verification and validation simulations. Details are found in the wikis called [FDS Verification Process](https://github.com/firemodels/fds/wiki/FDS-Verification-Process) and [FDS Validation Process](https://github.com/firemodels/fds/wiki/FDS-Validation-Process).

Make sure the FDS python environment is activated and run the main script from this top level of this folder.  For example:

```
(fds_python_env) $ python FDS_verification_script.py
...
```
